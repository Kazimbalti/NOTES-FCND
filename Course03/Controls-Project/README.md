### Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
- [X] scenario 2
- [X] scenario 3
- [X] scenario 4
- [X] scenario 5

### C++

#### Scenario 2
- [X] Roll should less than 0.025 radian of nominal for 0.75 seconds (3/4 of the duration of the loop).
- [X] Roll rate should less than 2.5 radian/sec for 0.75 seconds.


#### Scenario 3
- [X] X position of both drones should be within 0.1 meters of the target for at least 1.25 seconds.
- [X] Quad2 yaw should be within 0.1 of the target for at least 1 second.


#### Scenario 4
- [X] Position error for all 3 quads should be less than 0.1 meters for at least 1.5 seconds.


#### Scenario 5
- [X] Position error of the quad should be less than 0.25 meters for at least 3 seconds.


### Python (Optional)
